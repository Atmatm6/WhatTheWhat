<h1>What The What Wiki Hoped To Be Awesome.</h1>

<p>I give a huge thanks to oxguy3 and his Craftboot Modpack Launcher! (https://github.com/oxguy3/craftboot)
He made it but I made the modpack so I hope you enjoy it!
I worked hard on it, real hard!
I even had to make this page you are reading!

But I hope you enjoy and wait for my Mods: What is Minecraft, Powered Up 1 and others to come.

To get a touch of What The What, go to<a href="http://bit.ly/what_the_what_jar">what_whe_what.jar</a>  and paste in bit.ly/WutDaWutModpackFiles
in the link space when you open the jar that was downloaded.
